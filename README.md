# dragon-cave-useful-scripts

**Requirements - pyautogui (for refresher.py)**

Contains utility scripts for the online game Dragon Cave. Currently has a click site opener and a refresher.

* *Dragon Cave Click Sites Opener*:

    Opens click sites where you can add your dragons for views in your default browser.
    All the click sites used do not need a log in. At the moment these 7 sites are opened:
    1) https://www.allureofnds.net/
    2) http://dragonbreederscave.com/index.php?page=hatcheryII
    3) http://hatching.club/
    4) http://greg-kennedy.com/dragcave/
    5) http://dc.evinext.com/
    6) http://lair.silverdrak.de/
    7) http://valleysherwood.com/


* *Refresher*:

    Refreshers browser as many times as you want after a 5 second delay. 
    Make sure to open your scroll in a browser before using the script and having
    it as the active tab while using the script. Most useful for low time (less than
    4 days left) dragons who's views is not 15 times the unique views.
